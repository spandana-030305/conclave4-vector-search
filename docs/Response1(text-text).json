        "text": "Post-discharge Outcomes of COVID-19 Patients in a Tertiary Care Hospital: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study ABSTRACT Introduction: Understanding the post-discharge outcomes of COVID-19 patients is essential for informed healthcare planning and support services. This study aimed to assess the physical health status of COVID-19 patients three months after discharge from a tertiary care hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. Methods: A descriptive follow-up study design was used, involving 200 COVID-19 discharged patients. Data were collected from healthcare facilities and participants through structured questionnaires and telephonic interviews. The study duration was between November 2020 to April 2021. Results: Persistence of COVID-19-related symptoms was reported by 49 (24.50%) of participants reported at follow-up, while 41 (20.50%) indicated previous symptoms from discharge. Conclusions: After discharge, most of patient returned to normal activities within three months. Persistence of symptoms and test positive rate was less in those patients. INTRODUCTION The global COVID-19 pandemic has presented an exceptional challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. 1 In response to this crisis, numerous studies have aimed to understand various aspects of the disease, from its clinical manifestations to therapeutic interventions. 2 - 4 However, the focus on the post-discharge phase remains limited. As COVID-19 affected millions of individuals globally, the management and care of discharged patients have gained increasing importance. While much attention has been directed toward acute disease management, there is a critical need to examine the longer-term consequences, recovery trajectories, and associated challenges patients face after leaving the hospital. 5 This study provides a comprehensive analysis of post-discharge outcomes of COVID-19-recovered patients. The aim of this study was to assess the post-discharge outcomes of COVID-19 patients, in terms of their physical health in a tertiary care hospital and one of the isolation centers in Kathmandu. METHODS In this descriptive follow-up study, we examined the post-discharge outcomes of COVID-19 patients in the context of Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Data were collected from a tertiary healthcare facility: the COVID-19 facility at Shree Birendra Hospital (SBH) and one of the isolation centers operated by the Nepal Army. Non-probability purposive sampling was done to select the study site. A census was done for the participants who met specific inclusion criteria over a six-month duration between November 2020 to April 2021. To be eligible, participants had to be COVID-19 patients admitted and discharged from either the COVID-19 facility at SBH or the designated isolation center of SBH to their homes. Additionally, they were required to"

        "text": "Chinese people evacuated from Iran to the quarantine centre of Gansu Province. We aim to provide critical and objective information to help control the spread of COVID-19 to other provinces and countries. 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Materials There were a total of 311 Chinese overseas citizens evacuated from Iran. All of these returnees had resided in provinces within Iran that had experienced high levels of local COVID-19 disease. None of the returnees had been tested or clinically screened for COVID-19 prior to their return to China. These returnees were quarantined in Lanzhou, Gansu Province upon arrival. On arrival at Lanzhou airport in Gansu Province, the returnees were isolated in a designated hotel and screened using clinical tools i.e. thermometer, and questions concerning any symptoms, any history of close contact with any known infected people or any persons with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. All of the returnees were tested using a swab of the oral/nasopharynx for PCR testing for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently, 37 COVID-19 patients were confirmed by lab testing by the Gansu Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention according to procedures described in Diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia ( Trial edition 6 ) [ 16 ]. These COVID-19 confirmed patients were admitted to the specialised hospitals for COVID-19 patients in Gansu; all other returnees were isolated in designated hotels for quarantine for 14 days. Demographic data, including sex, age, occupation, nationality and exposure history were provided by Gansu Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, and clinical data were provided by Lanzhou Pulmonary Hospital and Gansu Provincial Hospital. 2.2 Geographical analysis To display the spatial distribution pattern of the extent of COVID-19 infection, all confirmed COVID-19 cases amongst the returnees from Iran who arrived in Gansu were represented with different colours or shapes in maps of China and Iran, using the software Arcgis 12.2 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). The vector map of China was obtained from the National Fundamental Geographic Information System, China, and the vector map of Iran was downloaded from Global Administrative Areas ( https://gadm.org/data.html ). 2.3 Statistical analysis The statistical analysis included demographic characteristics, exposure history, clinical symptoms, and pre-existing illness. Median (IQR) was used to describe the ages of the returnees and case-patients due to the data being not normally distributed. For categorical variables, if expected cell sizes were <5, the Fisher exact test was used to compare the"

        "text": "Epidemiology of COVID-19 and the Utility of Cycle Threshold (Ct) Values in Predicting the Severity of Disease Objectives: Advanced molecular diagnostic methods like real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) play a vital role in the early recognition of viral infections, including the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therefore, in the context of the recent COVID-19 pandemic, this study aimed to determine the correlation of cycle threshold (Ct) values with symptoms in COVID-19-positive patients. Materials and methods: A retrospective study was conducted in a virus research diagnostic laboratory (VRDL) at a COVID-19-dedicated tertiary care hospital in South India. A total of 5563 COVID-19-positive patients were analyzed for symptom spectrum and duration of illness with Ct values of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Results: Around 80% (n= 4401) of the patients were symptomatic and the rest were asymptomatic. Among the symptomatic patients, fever (66%) was the most common symptom. About 44% of symptomatic patients had a low Ct value (Ct ≤ 24). There was a significant difference in symptoms among patients with low, medium, and high Ct values. In the subpopulation of symptomatic patients analyzed for the association of Ct value and duration of illness, the mean duration of illness was three days and almost 88% of the patients were tested within five days of onset of symptoms. It has been observed that a shorter duration of illness lowers the Ct values. A significant association was seen between the mean Ct value and days since symptom onset (p-value = 0.016). Conclusion: Most of the symptomatic patients had lower Ct values in comparison to the asymptomatic patients. A significant association between low Ct values and the duration of symptoms observed in our study explains the viral dynamics, i.e., higher viral shedding at the onset of symptoms and declines thereafter. Introduction In recent years we witnessed the emergence and re-emergence of many diseases, causing epidemics and pandemics [ 1 ]. These are still a matter of particular concern as they resulted in substantial morbidity and mortality. Even though many are recognized infectious diseases, significantly greater numbers remain unrecognized [ 2 ]. All these infectious diseases cause significant healthcare expenditure, especially in resource-poor countries like India [ 1 ]. In addition to accurate pathogen recognition, outcomes from infectious diseases also correlate with the time to pathogen identification [ 2 , 3 ]. Various epidemics and pandemics caused by the Ebola virus, influenza virus, Zika virus,"

The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0 (2011; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Office 2016; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington, United States). Continuous variables were expressed as mean and standard deviation and categorical variables were expressed as frequency and percentages. The association between the variables was determined using the chi-square test. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results Of the total 5563 COVID-19-positive patients included in the study, the majority of them were males (n= 3380, 60.7%) as opposed to females (n= 2183, 39.3%). The age of the study population ranged from one year to 95 years with a median age of 40 years. The majority of the cases investigated were in the age range of 18-40 years (n = 2508, 45%), followed by the elderly age group of 41-60 years (n = 2269, 41%), with paediatric and old age populations being least impacted, as seen in Table 1 .

        "text": "and upon return to China unlikely. Nevertheless, this caveat needs to be acknowledged when trying to clearly identify and quantitate the infection source and spread range. On 19 February 2020, the first two confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported at Qom, Iran, starting the outbreak of COVID-19 in Iran. In the current study, the confirmed COVID-19 patients among the returnees from Iran were all students from Al-Mustafa International University at the Qom and Gelstan campuses, which together enrol 9000 students [ 27 ]. The outbreak of COVID-19 at these university campuses, and the subsequent repatriation of international students’ to their home countries, has created an enormous challenge for the authorities to control the viral transmission [ 28 ]. The most immediate concern facing the Authorities of Disease Control around the world is working on blocking the viral transmission to ameliorate a COVID-19 pandemic. The number of new COVID-19 cases from the returnees were more than Gansu local existing cases on March 17, 2020 [ 29 ]. Importantly the routine quarantine period of 14 days for COVID-19 may not be suitable for the returnees, because it has been reported that the longest incubation period of COVID-2019 in China can be up to 19 days [ 30 ] and infectivity may persist for up to 21 days even after an apparently asymptomatic infection [ 31 ]. Thus, a substantial threat could occur in the community if such COVID-19 case(s) are misdiagnosed and these returnees are allowed to eventually proceed to their final destination(s) after 14 days quarantine. Although the infection rate was high (12%), there was a relatively low severe/critical attack rate among these returnees from Iran with only 2 (5%), which was far below the results from Jiangxi Province (18%) [ 32 ] and Gansu Province (17.1%) within China [ 7 ]. However, this rate is close to the age-based rate published recently by Imperial College London of approximately 1.2% of patients requiring hospitalisation in the age range 20–29 years [ 33 ]. Our explanation for such a difference might be due to most of the returnees being young adults with relatively competent host defence. The majority of these returnees were male students, which may be mainly due to the Universities preference for religious study in Iran [ 34 ]. Interestingly, the attack rate of COVID-19 amongst females was rather less than male (1:4.5) in our current study, which is very different"
