A notorious example in human history is the Irish potato famine in the nineteenth century, which was caused by the late blight pathogen <italic>Phytophthora infestans</italic> (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">He et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Petre et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Another prevalent phytopathogenic oomycete, <italic>Phytophthora sojae</italic>, is a causative agent of soybean root rot disease. Management of <italic>Phytophthora</italic> diseases is extremely difficult owing to their rapid adaptation to overcome or evade chemical pesticides and host genetic resistance (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Helliwell et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). As a consequence, interfering with pathogenicity is a desirable approach for the development of transgenic disease-resistant crops because it may confer durable resistance by avoiding pathogen adaptation with a low host fitness cost (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Li et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Many strategies have emerged to interfere with the pathogenicity of pathogens. For example, the fungal pathogen <italic>Sclerotinia sclerotiorum</italic> produces large amounts of oxalic acid (OA), which causes a wilting syndrome in infected sunflower, to ensure successful infection. Transgenic sunflower plants constitutively expressing a wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>) oxalate oxidase gene were able to detoxify OA and showed enhanced resistance to <italic>S</italic>. <italic>sclerotiorum</italic> (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Hu et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Similarly, manipulating the expression of essential pathogen genes <italic>in planta</italic> by utilizing RNA interference (RNAi) technology is also a promising approach for pathogen control. In particular, host-induced gene silencing (HIGS), by which plants produce artificial small RNAs (sRNAs) designed to silence target genes in a pathogen, has proven to be a viable technology (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Hou and Ma, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Koch and Wassenegger, 2021</xref>). For example, stable expression of <italic>PtMAPK1</italic> or <italic>PtCYC1</italic> hairpin RNAi constructs may confer highly effective disease resistance to the pathogenic fungus <italic>Puccinia triticina</italic> in susceptible wheat plants (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Panwar et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). More recently, <italic>BcTOR</italic> was found to participate in regulating the growth and pathogenicity of <italic>Botrytis cinerea</italic>, and transgenic plants expressing double-stranded <italic>BcTOR</italic> RNA through the HIGS method produced abundant small RNAs targeting <italic>BcTOR</italic>, significantly blocking the occurrence of <italic>B</italic>. <italic>cinerea</italic> in potato and tomato (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). With increasing understanding of pathogenicity mechanisms in diverse pathogens, new pathogen targets are continually being explored for the development of transgenic disease-resistant crops.</p><p id="p0015">To successfully infect and colonize host cells, each <italic>Phytophthora</italic> pathogen produces hundreds of RxLR (Arg-x-Leu-Arg) effectors that act mainly in the cytoplasm of host cells to suppress defenses and manipulate normal host growth and developmental processes (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Dou et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">He et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Petre et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). The RxLR effectors may bind with phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) to facilitate their translocation into and/or increase their stability in host cells (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Kale et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Yaeno et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lu et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Sun et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). PI3P is phosphorylated at the third position of the inositol head group and belongs to the phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), which play profound roles in a variety of cellular processes&#x000a0;such as cell signaling, membrane trafficking, and cytoskeletal dynamics (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Noack and Jaillais, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Qin and Wei, 2021</xref>). Interestingly, we have shown&#x000a0;that <italic>Phytophthora</italic> pathogens can synthesize abundant exogenous PI3P during infection to aid in RxLR actions; two specific phosphoinositide 3 kinases (PI3Ks), PI3K1 and PI3K2, are required for normal PI3P production and virulence of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lu et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). This process is particularly important because the amount of PI3P is usually low at the surface of plant cell membranes (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Kielkowska et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).</p><p id="p0020"><italic>Phytophthora</italic>-derived PI3P, an essential compound relied upon by the <italic>Phytophthora</italic> pathogen for infection, has emerged as an effective target for transgenic disease resistance in plants. For example, overexpression of the PI3P-specific binding domain FYVE enhances plant resistance to several <italic>Phytophthora</italic> pathogens by sequestering PI3P during infection (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lu et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Helliwell et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Pathogen-derived PI3P could be used to direct the preferential accumulation of antimicrobial peptides and proteins (AMPs) on the tissues of the invasive pathogen by fusion with FYVE&#x000a0;(<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). Here, we propose another strategy to interfere with pathogenicity of <italic>Phytophthora</italic> by metabolizing PI3P during infection. We generated a fusion of the soybean PR1a signal peptide with <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase AtPIP5K1, which can use PI3P as a substrate to generate PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Westergren et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Yaeno et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>), and we expressed this fusion in soybean and potato plants. We demonstrated that the synthesized AtPIP5K1 was secreted into the apoplastic regions and significantly reduced <italic>Phytophthora</italic>-derived PI3P accumulation during infection, thereby substantially enhancing plant resistance to the tested <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> isolates. Our findings indicate that enhancement of PI3P catabolism is a novel and promising strategy for generating plants with durable broad-spectrum <italic>Phytophthora</italic> resistance.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>SP-PIP5K1 is secreted into the apoplastic region to reduce PI3P accumulation</title><p id="p0025">Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinases (PIP5Ks) form distinct clades in their molecular phylogenetic tree and are involved in regulating various cellular processes, including growth, development, and biotic and abiotic stress&#x000a0;responses in plants (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). <italic>A</italic>. <italic>thaliana</italic> encodes 11 PIP5Ks that are distributed in different evolutionary clades and play different roles in plants (<xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Watari et&#x000a0;al., 2022</xref>).

We fused AtPIP5K1 with the functional soybean PR1a signal peptide at its N terminus (SP-PIP5K1) to ensure that AtPIP5K1 was secreted into the apoplastic regions during infection.

We confirmed that SP-PIP5K1 consistently exhibits effective PI3P catabolic activity in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic>, soybean, and potato systems, perhaps because SP-PIP5K1-catalyzed PI3P inactivation happens primarily in the apoplast and at the pathogen surface. The kinase activity of SP-PIP5K1 is not affected by the internal cell environment. These data suggest that SP-PIP5K1 is able to catabolize PI3P in the apoplast, thereby suppressing <italic>Phytophthora</italic> infection.</p><p id="p0115">It is regrettable that the dynamic changes in other PIPs were not detected in the SP-PIP5K1-expressing plants. Enhanced disease resistance caused by overexpression of SP-PIP5K1 may be related to the possible production of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. However, recent work&#x000a0;has shown that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> acts as a susceptibility factor in plant resistance against fungal pathogens (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Shimada et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Qin et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). For example, reduced PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels in the <italic>pip5k1 pip5k2 mutant</italic> inhibit fungal pathogen development and cause disease resistance (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Qin et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Overexpression of PIP5K3, which promotes PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> biosynthesis, increases plant susceptibility to <italic>Colletotrichum</italic> infection (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Shimada et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). It is likely that overexpression of SP-PIP5K1 mainly functions to reduce the PI3P level in the apoplast, which then enhances plant resistance. On the other hand, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> may play a distinct role in plant resistance against fungi and <italic>Phytophthora</italic>. These possibilities require further study.</p><p id="p0120">Haustoria interfaces have emerged as delivery sites of pathogen-encoded virulence factors known as effectors (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bozkurt and Kamoun, 2020</xref>). A number of <italic>Phytophthora</italic> RxLR effectors were found to accumulate around haustoria (<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Jing et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bozkurt and Kamoun, 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Petre et&#x000a0;al., 2021</xref>). However, the&#x000a0;mechanism of effector delivery into host cells remains unclear. Bozkurt and Kamoun considered a possible transport mechanism in which pathogens employ extracellular vesicles loaded with effectors in haustoria that then enter plant cells by exosome fusion (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Bozkurt and Kamoun, 2020</xref>). PI3P usually targets multivesicular bodies/late endosomes (MVBs/LEs) (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Qin and Wei, 2021</xref>). We found that clear signals of SP-PIP5K1 were observed in the vesicular structures that accumulate&#x000a0;around <italic>Phytophthora</italic> haustoria during infection, suggesting that SP-PIP5K1 is able to target and catabolize PI3P to reduce its accumulation in the plant&#x02013;<italic>Phytophthora</italic> interface, accounting for the decrease in PI3P-facilitated RxLR translocation into the host cell. We found that SP-PIP5K1 interfered with the Avr1k-mediated action of <italic>P</italic>.&#x000a0;<italic>sojae</italic> in the transgenic soybean lines. Interestingly, disruption or inhibition of <italic>Phytophthora</italic> PI3P production compromises the resistance conferred by AtPIP5K1. It is possible that the functional form of AtPIP5K1 is activated by the PI3P binding and phosphorylation reaction. Without the presence of sufficient PI3P, AtPIP5K1 loses its acting target. Hence, its existence would not make a significant difference to the plant defense system. These results demonstrate that secreted AtPIP5K1 enhances plant <italic>Phytophthora</italic> resistance by interfering with the action of an RxLR effector.</p><p id="p0125">Because PI3P is a small signaling molecule that interacts with a wide range of RxLRs from different <italic>Phytophthora</italic> pathogens, SP-PIP5K1 can potentially serve as a regulator of durable broad-spectrum <italic>Phytophthora</italic> resistance in host plant species. Transgenic soybean and potato plants expressing SP-PIP5K1 exhibited substantially enhanced resistance to several <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic> isolates, respectively. OsPIP5K1 overexpression has been reported to cause no obvious developmental changes in rice (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Fang et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, no visible alterations in growth, morphology, or yield were observed in SP-PIP5K1 transgenic soybean or potato plants, indicating that AtPIP5K1 enhances plant <italic>Phytophthora</italic> resistance without the trade-off of a growth penalty. AtPIP5K1 homologs in soybean and potato are also likely to be functional if we use them to enhance <italic>Phytophthora</italic> resistance in transgenic plants. Pathogens often evolve rapidly to evade the resistance genes deployed in popular cultivars (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Helliwell et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Leesutthiphonchai et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>). Compared with conventional breeding, genetic engineering of disease resistance can shorten breeding cycles and facilitate the interspecific transfer of resistance genes (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0130">In conclusion, our work demonstrates a novel strategy for effective control of <italic>Phytophthora</italic> diseases in transgenic crop plants using secreted PI3P-metabolizing enzymes. We generated stable transgenic soybean and potato lines with significantly improved resistance against <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sojae</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>infestans</italic>, respectively. Ectopic expression of the PI3P kinase had no negative effects on plant growth or yield. Our work proposes a new route for achieving durable broad-spectrum disease control for a wide range of crop species by manipulating phosphoinositides with critical functions. This technology could potentially reduce yield losses caused by <italic>Phytophthora</italic> or other pathogens&#x000a0;and decrease the reliance on chemical pesticides that are increasingly being spurned for environmental, health, and economic reasons.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>Plant materials, microbial strains, and growth conditions</title><p id="p0135">In this study, the soybean cultivar&#x000a0;Williams 82 was grown and maintained in plant growth chambers at an ambient temperature of 25&#x000b0;C with a 16-h day/8-h night photoperiod.
